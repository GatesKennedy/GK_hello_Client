      Needing to stay calm and leading a team through long hours has suited me well for what I’ve experienced in the software industry.
      On the first day of my first job as a developer, a crippling situation with the company’s database occurred. 
      I suddenly found myself deputized. 
      I served as the liaison to the fraught development team while tracking the progress of a team that was tasked with repopulating an inhuman amount of data.
      By the second day I was able to project the progress and saw it was likely a deadline would be missed, so I decided to script for the task after hours.
      I ended up with a parsing algorithm that could translate any amount of raw data from google docs and repopulate the damaged system. 
      This may sound like a nightmare but, again, I felt like I was discovering magic.`,
